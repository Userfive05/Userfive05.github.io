    <h1>Home Assistant Interactive Floorplan</h1>
        <p class="text-block">
            I saw someone on Reddit made an interactive floorplan for Home Assistant in a Pokemon style view. I thought I could make one in the style of a cartoonish videogame, but that meant generating all the graphics which lead me down a rabbit hole of different methods, finally landing on Blender being the application of choice. I knew nothing of Blender to start, I figured this would be a weekend project, but like most of my projects, that has ballooned into several weeks, so far..</a>
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="images//floorplan/originimage.png" alt="carton">
        <p class="text-block">
            I found a website that would allow me to use a tileset to create a simple floorplan to see just how easy it would be to get the image to react to lights turing on and off. <a href="https://pixel-salvaje.itch.io/tinyhouse" class="project-title">You can try it yourself on itch.io</a>
        </p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        
        <p class="text-block">
            I used an image editor to seperate the dark areas from light and then used the floorplan editor in Home Assistant to assign some lights. This is what it would liook like if only the kitchen light is on.

        <p class="text-block">
            Seeing how easy this was I figured the rest would be a cakewalk. How wrong I was. Now to figure out what I wanted it to look like in the end, the following image is what I have in mind, ignore the obvious AI errors and weirdness.

        <p class="text-block">
            I figured I could find Tile sets to do what I wanted, throw them into a photo editor, rearrange, add some cool lights and I would be done! Easy couple hours. I then found that there were no free tilesets of what I wanted, so I turned to buying them online, still couldn't find em. I changed course, why not pay someone online to make the whole thing for me, too much money, I'm cheap. I have reasonable skills with CAD software, so maybe I could just throw something together real quick! I chose Blender as the software of choice, of which I have zero experience.

        After some crash courses I was able to make a reasonable looking bed and a couch. good progress!
